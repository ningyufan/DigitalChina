                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, April 4, 2018, the second group of 172 students came to the stage to show their team demeanor, presided over by group leader Chen Zuo.</div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They first introduced the origin and significance of the group names, "Dream control" means that each of them can realize their dreams, but also on behalf of their pursuit of youth and regretless. The team leader also said, "The road to dream is still long, and we need to work hard. On the road of our dreams, we need to endure loneliness, and we need to persevere in all kinds of frustrations.</div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we talked about their group's organizational rules, and made relevant requirements in life and learning. As the saying goes, "no rules, no square circle", rules are indispensable for every group. They also set many goals, big or small. As long as they persist, supervise each other and believe that their goals will be achieved. In the process of team introduction, everyone details their responsibilities and hobbies.</div>

                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the team show, Mr. Chen commented on their exhibition: "The Dream Control Group prepared for the exhibition carefully, everyone was very attentive. Each group has its own characteristics, and she hopes that the next group will show unexpectedly.</div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They get together because of their dreams and because of their common hobbies. Although their dreams are far away from them, as long as they persevere, there will always be a day to realize their dreams.</div>

                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Monday, the fifth week, the second group of Computer Class 171 brought a different style of exhibition. What is the difference between girls and girls? Let's go into the classroom together and see their wonderful show.</div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, they introduced themselves in turn, then shouted out their group names, slogans and goals, and finally began their performance. What they bring to you is a sketch display.</div>

                    </div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who says that women are inferior to men? Although the second group are all girls, their momentum is not inferior. They shout out their group names loudly and forcefully - we are different; they shout slogans that belong to them differently - life does not accept plainness, fate only collects brilliance; they shout out their goal of struggle - No. Having passed the fourth grade, I won the first place. In the passionate cry, as if to see different women, they are not the same.</div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After shouting for support, they began to perform sketches. The sketch is to bring laughter to the students. Although they are not real actors and perform imperfectly, they still win applause and laughter from the students. This sketch mainly tells about a company due to product quality problems, the leadership convened the heads of departments to meet, at the meeting, the heads of departments not only late, but also shirk responsibility, blame each other, complain each other, and ultimately put the responsibility on the leadership.</div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By showing this different team, they told us that we must unite and love, help each other and solve problems together. We can't shirk our responsibilities as in the sketches. Only by uniting and working hard can we succeed.</div>                
                    <div>

                    </div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Teacher Chen Baizhi evaluated the second group's presentation. Teacher Chen said that the second group had a good idea and personality, which showed their differences, but the performance was not vivid enough to express the effect well. Hope that the second group can continue to work hard to show more differences and bring more excitement. I also hope that the later team will have better works and bring more different personality exhibitions.</div>

                    </div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second group's elegant demeanor display is to bring you a sketch, through which we can tell you the truth of unity. Is this kind of elegant demeanor display very different? More exciting performances are yet to come! Let's look forward to the next group.</div>

                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Dec. 11, 2017, Mr. Chen Baizhuang led 172 classes to conduct a quality development activity of professional literacy course in 400 meters track and field.</div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the beginning of the activity, the students of Class 172 first carried out the pre-class song, Lala Song. Then, Mr. Chen introduced the requirements, process and purpose of the activity.</div>

                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple pre-class song can not satisfy the students, so Mr. Chen led us to dance an interesting rabbit dance. At first, the students danced in a mess. After one or two attempts, the students could keep up with the rhythm and complete a whole dance with ease.</div>

                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After warming up, the game begins. The first game is "grasp fingers", the rules of the game are: all students in a circle, hands raised on both sides, left palm down, right index finger vertical upward against the left palm of the students next to, when hearing the keywords, not only to grasp the fingers of the students, but also to ensure that they can not be caught, the people caught want. Accept punishment, so as to exercise the students'concentration and reaction. At the beginning of the first round, when the host reads the keyword "crow", all the students quickly evade and grasp their classmates' fingers. The captured classmates form circles inward. At the end of the story, there are only two classmates in the innermost circle. Congratulations on their punishment - impromptu Watch Play.</div>

                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the second round, the students were still in the mood of expectation and excitement for the second game, "Unwrap Ring", which tested the sense of unity. Mr. Chen divided the students into four groups to play the game. Shortly after the beginning of the game, a group easily unraveled this intricate handnet, and then took the initiative to help other groups that did not unravel, and finally completed the game, thus showing the super cohesion of 172 classes!</div>

                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, everyone! Welcome to the wonderful class of Computer 172 with Xiaobian's step. On Tuesday, the seventh week, Mr. Chen led the small partners of Computer 172 to Houde 3305 classroom for the last PPT team exhibition. Tell you a little secret, there are seven small partners transferred to the computer 172 class! There are also three small partners because there are some things that have not been reported. Here, let's give them a warm welcome first. Next, Mr. Chen asked the new comers to introduce themselves, and then assigned a new group member to each group.</div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the last class of the semester where you can have a team style exhibition. This week's vocational course is coming to an end. The tacit understanding of each team is getting higher and higher after the formation and team style exhibition. This is a way to become better and better. Recalling the exhibition of the first three groups, the third group showed Xiao Ming's Trouble, the second group produced a short video collection, and the first group of short team videos, they all received five-star praise from students! Teacher Chen also praised their excellent performance. This is the affirmation that they prepared with all their heart. What will be done in this class is the wonderful demonstration of the following four groups. Let's enter the wonderful class together.</div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This class is the last group style exhibition, time is a little rush, Mr. Chen decided to let the latter four groups together, give each group 10 minutes to carry out their team style exhibition.</div>
                    <div>
                        <img class="img2_scope" height="100%" width="80%" src="@/assets/images/ysblock/img5_scope_1.webp"/>
                    </div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the fourth group shows you their elegance. This time, the group leader Moxian Gao, who is tall and handsome, will give a lecture on PPT. This team is composed of two boys and three girls. It forms a team in the form of "Our Home". The team name is Find Dream. The slogan is "Seek the voice of the soul, full of stars".</div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the fourth team is not very large, only five small partners, but each team member has its own characteristics, strength can not be underestimated! Next, after the group members took turns to introduce themselves and the group leader gave PPT explanations, they sang "Dreams Begin with Heart" for you. Two boys sang songs and three girls performed hand dances. The performances were excellent and showed their team spirit.</div>                
                    <div>
                        <img class="img2_scope" height="100%" width="80%" src="@/assets/images/ysblock/img5_scope_2.webp"/>
                    </div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next came the group 5 exhibition. PPT was introduced by lively and lovely Mowenjing. First, Mowenjing showed us their group name: Tianyifang, which is a warm small team. Next, the team members took turns to introduce their "personal files" and detailed future plans. Although the team is all female compatriots, but the division of labor is clear, the goal is also clear, strength and momentum is no less than male compatriots, they are a ragged team. Finally, Tianyifang's program is to recite Xu Zhimo's English version of "Farewell to Cambridge"（Saying Good-bay to Cambridge Again——by Xu Zhi Mo.）</div>
                    <div>
                        <img class="img2_scope" height="100%" width="80%" src="@/assets/images/ysblock/img5_scope_3.webp"/>
                    </div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next is the group elegance exhibition of the sixth group, which is given by Li Fangdan, a funny student. Li Fangdan first introduced their team name: Seven Stars Beidou Team. This team name implies seven stars connecting, hanging in the far north forever, solidarity and mutual assistance, and unity of purpose. They shouted the slogan "Stick to the end, never give up". Their group song is "The world applauds you". Then there was the time for members to show themselves. They made a sensation by using the back music "Can you feel it" as the back music for each member of them. Next, Li Fangdan continued to explain the team's goals and future plans. Finally, it is the elegant exhibition of their team, singing their team song for everyone. Before singing, they gathered around to cheer for themselves! Maybe it was too exciting, so that the climax was broken, and there were some interludes in the middle, but they calmly finished the song. This spirit of perseverance is the embodiment of their slogan!</div>

                    </div>
                    <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team elegance of Computer Class 172 is over here. Because of the time, Mr. Chen did not comment on each group one by one. However, the dedication and seriousness of each group to the development of elegance deserve to be affirmed. Hope that in the next time, they can continue to maintain their team spirit and dedication, so that the team can develop better.</div>
