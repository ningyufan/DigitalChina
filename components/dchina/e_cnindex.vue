                                        On the other hand, the application of information technology, such as big data, cloud computing, Internet of Things, will help break through.

                                    To speed up the construction of digital China is to adapt to the new historical orientation of China's development, implement the new development concept in an all-round way, cultivate new momentum through information technology, promote new development with new momentum, create new brilliance with new development, and constantly satisfy people's yearning for a better life. In the area of coordinated development of regional informatization, there are many bright spots. With the coordinated development of regional informatization in the Yangtze River Delta, Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, the regional digital economic growth pole is forming, the regional network information technology innovation system is gradually constructed, and the level of regional information sharing and business collaboration is obviously improved.

How to promote poverty alleviation and rural revitalization through information construction has also become one of the focuses of digital China construction in 2019. "In the future, we will establish a policy system and working mechanism for the integration of urban and rural informatization, promote the construction of digital countryside and new intelligent city as a whole, and promote the rational allocation of urban and rural data resources; coordinate the implementation of digital rural development strategy, accelerate the construction of rural information infrastructure, develop rural digital economy and strengthen agriculture. Rural science and technology innovation supply, building intelligent green countryside, promoting the modernization of rural governance capacity, deepening information service for the people, and stimulating the endogenous power of rural revitalization. Yang Xiaowei said that by consolidating and enhancing the effectiveness of network poverty alleviation and innovating poverty alleviation measures, we can definitely create an upgraded version of network poverty alleviation and digital poverty alleviation.

                                    Out of the village, through a long-distance connection, the village doctor in Changjia Town, Gaoqing, Shandong Province, sits in the bathroom and can consult the villagers with experts from 301 Hospital, Beijing, 400 kilometers away.
                                    Telemedicine is an important part of the construction of Gaoqing Smart City. This small and medium-sized town of Shandong, with a population of less than 400,000, uses advanced technology such as Internet of Things, Big Data and Cloud Computing to enable urban management, and strives to achieve good governance, benefit the people and prosperity.
                                </p>

                                    Smart cities used to concentrate on the first-and second-tier cities in China, as well as some of the more developed third-tier cities. Nowadays, more and more county-level cities like Gaoqing are devoting themselves to the upsurge of building smart cities. While resolving the "big city disease", smart cities extend to counties to help grassroots solve the development problems.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In recent years, China's smart city construction is in the ascendant. Tang Shenghong, vice president of the People's Network Research Institute, said that according to incomplete statistics, at present, about 700 cities in China have proposed or are building smart cities, accounting for 70% of the total number of smart cities proposed by the world in the same period, in 100% of cities above the deputy provincial level, 93% of cities above the prefecture level and some cities at the county level.

                                    Rapidly updated information and communication technologies such as the Internet, cloud computing, big data and the Internet of Things are profoundly reshaping the application scenarios of transportation, medical treatment, agriculture, finance, communication and social governance.
                                    At the same time, with the development of smart city construction, the development of smart city obviously shows the trend of popularization from large and medium-sized cities to small and medium-sized cities, especially to county areas.

                                   County governments connect cities and towns with the vast countryside. The construction of smart county towns is an indispensable node for the realization of digital China, and plays an increasingly prominent role in promoting the transformation and upgrading of county economy.
                                    Participants said that the key point of future construction of smart cities in China is how to use innovative elements to achieve the popularization and practice of smart cities in County areas. Developing smart cities in county areas is an important work in future construction of smart cities in China.
