                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yulin News Network-Yulin Daily News Xingye County has developed and established a large data platform of "poverty alleviation cloud" in Xingye County to promote supervision and inspection in the field of poverty alleviation by scientific and technological means, focusing on the special actions of "three eyes and three checks" (the implementation of the policy, the unhealthy wind, the security of funds, the corruption, the inadequate performance of duties and checks).<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that the platform is based on the existing data of archiving and card establishment, and integrates the data resources of relevant departments to form a large data integrated management platform for poverty alleviation work in the county, such as unified command and dispatch of poverty alleviation, project fund supervision, task inspection and assessment, information service sharing, interactive exchange and participation. This platform regards the poverty alleviation situation of the county's 75.81 million poor people as the key point of dynamic supervision. Information about the basic family situation, production and living conditions, causes of poverty, assistance measures and the persons responsible for helping each poverty alleviation object is input into the "poverty alleviation cloud" big data platform. The supervision organ of the Discipline Commission can randomly select the poverty alleviation object through the platform. Through screening, comparison and verification, we supervised and inspected the existence of good relatives, friends and fraud in the process of accurate identification of poverty alleviation, and strengthened the supervision of the process of accurate object identification.<br>
