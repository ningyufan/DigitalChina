                Entering the scene of "gathering and generalizing" the data of Guangxi Digital Government Integration Platform, the author has seen a hot scene. The Autonomous Region Big Data Development Bureau organizes the Autonomous Region Information Center.
Digital Guangxi Group Co., Ltd., together with 41 departments and bureaus and nearly 100 staff members, has been working intensively to promote the construction of Digital Government Integration Platform in Guangxi, focusing on the "hard bone" of "gathering and universalizing" government data.

               "We should act in a practical way, take prompt action and make every effort to implement the action plan of"gathering and generalizing"the government affairs data of the people's government of the autonomous region, so that enterprises and the masses can run at most once, or even not at all." Drill deep and dry, March 20,
The Autonomous Region's Big Data Development Bureau held a meeting to tackle the key problems of "gathering and universalizing" government affairs data in the whole region. It acted quickly and pushed forward with all its efforts. The work of "gathering and universalizing" government affairs data in the whole region opened the prelude.

                The motivation of the fortification comes from the responsibility. We should manage government data, use them and live up to solve the bottleneck of long-term "isolated island" of government data and "isolated" professional systems of departments and bureaus, and better release data dividends.
This is the responsibility and responsibility of the Autonomous Region Big Data Development Bureau to tackle the key problems of "gathering and generalizing" government data.

                In order to make the action more vigorous and dynamic, the Autonomous Region Big Data Development Bureau has worked hard from the top level design to compile the "Guangxi Digital Government Integration Platform" work implementation plan, focusing on six major objectives, such as data barriers.
Forming 18 specific action plans, organizing the technical personnel of the Autonomous Region Information Center and Digital Guangxi Group Co., Ltd. to take charge of the promotion point to point, giving the technical personnel space and platform to display their skills, driving the vitality of talent development, and putting the task objectives on the wall.
Pushing the tables forward and countering each other forms the driving force of pushing the work backwards.

              Heavy responsibilities lie on our shoulders. We walk steadily, one after another. On April 12, staff of 41 district-level units were stationed in the district, and technicians were given one-to-one and point-to-point guidance. Five batches of business training were organized around technical difficulties.
Breakthrough of one department, one problem, one problem and one problem; rigid implementation of the working mechanism of "daily report progress, daily supervision progress, red and black list", so that those who lag behind in progress "red face, sweating", "you catch up with me, slow progress is backward" work atmosphere effective convergence... The top-down promotion of implementation has set off a wave of aggregating and universalizing government data.

                The construction of Digital Government Integration Platform in Guangxi is a systematic project, each work is closely linked. The aggregation of big data is the foundation and core of the whole digital government integration platform, and is also the hardest "hard bone". It can be said that the quality and effectiveness of the aggregation and generalization of government data are of great significance and influence to the construction of the whole digital government platform.

                Around the "convergence and universality" of government data, the Autonomous Region Big Data Development Bureau promotes and integrates the four dimensions of "convergence, convergence, use and evaluation". Through the construction of government affairs cloud, the four levels of interconnection and communication of autonomous region, city, county and township network of e-government external network will be realized; large data of government affairs information resources sharing will be established, data aggregation and sharing will be promoted, enterprises and the masses will run less and data will run more;
Establish the evaluation index system of government information sharing, as well as the evaluation mechanism of government information sharing and administrative accountability management. Through the four dimensions of "communication, reuse, use and evaluation", we will gradually realize data aggregation, sharing and common, innovative application, so that big data can better serve people's livelihood and society.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Only by walking together and borrowing from each other can we achieve a steady and far-reaching goal. Since April 12, when 41 departments and bureaus were stationed in the field and centralized office, they have cooperated actively, focusing on the "difficult points" of technical management, "5+2" and "white plus black" to overcome difficulties. The "gathering and generalization" of government affairs data has made a sound start. 41 departments directly under the district government have completed the list of resources, and uploaded 201,170 electronic license historical data. Access to 26 applications of Guangxi Digital Government Mobile Terminal (APP).

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                More noteworthy is that on April 30, four units of the Forestry Bureau of the Autonomous Region, the Transport Department of the Autonomous Region, the Public Security Department of the Autonomous Region and the Water Conservancy Department of the Autonomous Region first connected the professional business system with the digital government operation management system, thus realizing the "whole process traces, whole process supervision" of the business process and avoiding the second input of the system. It is of symbolic significance to seize the first "small highland" of "gathering and universalizing" government data.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               Do the present work well and prepare for the future work. After the first "small highland" was conquered by the action of "gathering and generalizing" of government data, teams around "the second and the third small highland" stepped up their preparations and were ready to start, trying to solve the outstanding contradictions in the key links of "gathering and generalizing" of government data resources, and to open the main artery of the whole chain of government data resources, so as to realize the goal of "gathering and generalizing" of government data resources. Maximizing the value of government data resources.
