                The 5G standard is composed of many technologies, and coding is a very basic technology. Among the 5G related standards, there was a heated debate on channel coding standards among the world's major camps at one time. In 2016,
                Polar, which is pushed by Chinese telecommunications companies, becomes the control channel coding. This is the first breakthrough in the field of channel coding in China and lays the foundation for China to strive for more voice rights in 5G standard than before.
                "From this point of view, China can be said to be in the forefront of the world to a certain extent."

                From May 21 to 25, the International Organization for Standardization of Mobile Communications (ISO) 3GPP Working Group held the last meeting of the 5G first stage standard-setting in Busan, South Korea. It is reported that,
                This meeting will determine the full content of the 3GPP R15 standard. It is expected that at the plenary meeting in the United States next month, 3GPP will announce the first phase of the 5G standard.
                So, what kind of organization is 3GPP responsible for Telecom standards? How is the widely concerned 5G standard formulated? How much voice do Chinese enterprises have in the process of formulating 5G standards?
                With these problems, Beijing Youth Daily reporters interviewed people in the industry.

                <b>The 5G Independent Networking Standard is expected to be released and established next month. </b>
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                At this 3GPP Busan conference, all the working groups that develop 5G wireless technology will gather at this meeting to finalize the relevant standard technologies for the commercialization of 5G RAN.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                About 1500 Standard experts from chipsets, mobile phone and equipment suppliers and mobile operators will attend the meeting to complete the first phase of 5G standard.
                It includes 5G wireless access technology providing ultra-high-speed data and ultra-low latency, and conformance testing methods for 5G terminals. In short, after the Busan Conference,
                In the first phase of 5G, the standard of independent networking is coming out soon.

                Several Chinese enterprises, including Huawei, OPPO, VIVO and other communication equipment and mobile phone manufacturers, also participated in the discussion and submitted proposals. Yang Chaobin, president of Hua5G product line, said that as planned,
                The meeting will complete the standard technology for 5G Independent Networking (SA), which will be officially announced at next month's U.S. plenary meeting, and Huawei has prepared a proposal. After the standard has been determined,
                Equipment companies have standard-based equipment for commercial use.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Previously, 3GPP determined that 5G standardization was divided into two stages: the first stage started with R15 as 5G standard, which was completed in June 2018; the second stage started with R16 as 5G standard, which was completed in December 2019.
                The first phase of 5G will be finalized at the 3GPP conference in the United States next month.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <b>How many 5G standards are there?</b>
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Some readers can't help wondering, didn't last year say that 3GPP has established a 5G standard? How can we confirm it again now? Why is there any argument that the final standard will wait until 2019, or even 2020?
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               "The last time we determined the non-independent networking standard, this time we will determine the 5G independent networking standard." Senior communications observer Xiang Ligang pointed out in an interview that non-independent networking, in short, is not an independent 5G network.
                Integrating with other things, such as networking with 4G or even 3G, and 5G independent networking means that there is no 4G, a fully established 5G network.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               "In non-independent networking, what about 5G? 5G as a supplement, the big network is 4G, but in some hot areas, such as Olympic venues, CBD and so on, these local areas increase hotspots through 5G to improve network speed and user perception and experience.
                But the whole network is still not 5G. By contrast, 5G independent networking means that the entire network is completely covered by 5G. Xiang Ligang further explained.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                "The establishment of independent networking standards means that the deployment standards of 5G network have tended to be perfect," said Xiang Ligang. The core of non-independent networking is hotspot, which solves the problem of local hotspot coverage on a small scale.
                The 5G comprehensive network coverage problem can be solved, so the establishment of the standard is very important. We can think that the 5G standard is further improved.
