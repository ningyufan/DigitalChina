                Recently, "This Screen May Change Fate" has become the focus of attention, and the change of science and technology to Chinese education has been hotly debated again. Beyond live broadcasting,
                Intelligent teachers using AI technology are also seen as tools to change future education.
                Recently, the world-renowned single education award, Dandan Award, falls on Larry Hutches, a professor of statisticians at Northwestern University and Anant Agwal, founder of EDX, an online learning platform.
                Chen Yidan, the founder of Yidan Award, believes that the unequal distribution of educational resources and the inequity of the starting line of education can be solved by using science and technology to lead and innovate the educational system.
                Around the issue of AI education, the two winners told Nanfang Daily that the intelligent AI teacher is a typical example of the application of artificial intelligence education, which can provide a more personalized learning model.
                But generally speaking, there is still a long way to go for the application of AI in the education industry.

                AI Helps Realize Individualized Learning

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                For "how to evaluate the effect of an educational decision-making", there has been a lack of quantitative indicators and basis in educational circles. Hedges's research achievement "Integrative Analysis and Statistics" solves the long-standing problem of lacking quantitative indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of education and other practical basis.
                This innovative statistical method can integrate interdisciplinary research results and can be used in social, medical and biological sciences as well as education.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Hedges believes that although AI is currently in the experimental stage, there is a very good case, that is, the wise AI teacher. "Traditionally, a teacher must be an expert in a particular area or content.
                When teaching students, some students may have personalized needs. If every student wants to solve problems individually, maybe every student should be equipped with a teacher. This is the traditional mode.
                Hedges pointed out that AI can form an intelligent teacher system according to the characteristics of each student, and students can help themselves achieve better learning on personalized issues through intelligent AI teachers.

                EdX platform created by Agwal shows a corner of future education. On the edX platform, students can learn programming courses offered by Cambridge or calculus at MIT independently.
                On the edX platform, there are not only courses taught by AI wisdom teachers, but also teaching experiences such as VR/AR. Over the past six years, edX has moved courses from more than 130 universities and institutions around the world to the Internet.
                Including courses in Harvard, Cambridge, Peking University, Tsinghua and other universities, and more importantly, most of the courses are free and open. So far, edX has given 18 million people around the world free online learning opportunities.
                EDX also promotes the integration of online education and employment by issuing certificates to students who have completed the course. Many trainees with EDX certificates have been interviewed by multinational companies.
                Many enterprises also use edX platform to help employees improve their professional skills.

                "Science and technology, including artificial intelligence, are very powerful tools that can have a great impact on the education industry and other industries. AI can solve many problems, including personalized learning and personalized online learning.
                ” In an interview with Nanfang Daily, Agwal said that on the edX platform, there are many students who can use AI to achieve personalized learning, including courses on edX at Harvard University.
                There are many courses on the platform that are now better taught with AI. "Although the application of AI in education is still in the experimental stage, it will bring great changes to education in the future."

                Human Teachers Can't Be Replaced
            </p><br/>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Intelligent AI teachers can really be expected for China with a large gap in educational level. But at the application level, both experts pointed out that there is still a long way to go in the application of AI in the education industry.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Agwal cited an example to illustrate that AI faces more challenges in the education industry than in other industries. On the edX platform, I wanted to launch a project to mark papers with robotic artificial intelligence.
                At first, 100 papers were graded by machines, and then 100,000 papers were graded by learned AI machines. But the final score was complained by many university teachers.
                Because university teachers don't believe in machines as a result of AI scores.
            </p><br/>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The unavoidable fact is that many industries are now facing the risk of being replaced by artificial intelligence, which also exists in the education industry. Hedges believes that human teachers will still play a very important role in the future.
                "Despite the existence of intelligent teachers, the artificial intelligence technology behind them is actually imitating human intelligence, based on human intelligence model. Although machines can explore themselves through artificial intelligence,
                Explore some behavior, but the premise is that there must be human intelligence model, behavior for its reference and learning.
            </p><br/>
             <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                "In a very simple, mechanical level of operation, intelligent teachers can be very helpful. But in other areas, such as innovative thinking and narrative ability, I personally don't think it can change the development of the whole industry.
                ” Agwal stressed that there is no fixed formula to refer to when it comes to creativity and innovative thinking, including talking about professional ethics, right and wrong, and that learning is often based on personal judgment, which also makes the role of human teachers irreplaceable.
