            <h3>World Telecom Day focuses on big data for the first time, accelerating the layout of digital economy</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Unlike previous years'emphasis on telecommunications technology and services, this year's World Telecom Day focuses on big data for the first time. Zhang Feng, Chief Engineer of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, believes that this shows that consensus has been reached on vigorously developing the digital economy.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Zhang Feng said: "The theme determined by the International Telecommunication Union, closely linked to the current pulse of industry and industry development, reflects the common concern of the industry and all sectors of society. It will play a positive role in guiding the global information and communication industry to further enhance the level of big data technology and industrial development and serve the development of digital economy in various countries." Function."

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Behind this theme outline, telecom operators and others are accelerating the layout of the digital economy. For example, China Mobile's (Western) Cloud Computing Center recently officially launched, will effectively promote the development and innovation of new technologies such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, 5G and so on. For example, China Unicom has promoted the development of big data business to the company's strategic level.

            <h3>Digital economy brings three big dividends, and economic growth takes the lead.</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                There are good reasons for the unprecedented importance attached to the digital economy. A report recently released by the Tencent Research Institute has formed the Internet + digital economy index by bringing together 131 dimensions of large sample data. The report shows that the digital economy is bringing China three big dividends. The first big dividend is economic growth, said Zhou Ziqi, a researcher at Tencent Research Institute. There is a linear relationship between the digital economic index and economic growth.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               Zhou Ziqi thinks: "Internet + digital economy index increases 1 points every time, GDP rises roughly 140 billion 602 million yuan. The index increased by 161.95 points in 2016, multiplying 161.95 by 140602 million yuan, or 22.77 trillion yuan. The total amount of GDP brought by digital economy is about 22.77 trillion yuan, which represents the total amount of digital economy in 2016.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The second big dividend is employment. The report shows that every 1 points of the Internet plus digital economy index will roughly add 17 thousand and 300 people to the new urban jobs. By this calculation, the number of new employment people brought by the digital economy in 2016 is more than 2 million 800 thousand.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The third big dividend is the catch-up effect. Now we are all talking about "overtaking in bends", for example, the central and western regions have been considering how to narrow the gap with the coastal areas, but without grasping the hand, I am afraid that "overtaking" is impossible to talk about. The report reveals that the digital economy can be a big catch.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Zhou Ziqi said: "For every increase in the index, the GDP of inland areas increased by 16.1948 billion yuan compared with that of coastal areas. The results show that the development of digital economy in inland areas is helpful for inland areas to catch up with the developed coastal areas. The reason is that the industrial digitalization and informatization in the developed coastal areas are relatively high, and the role of promoting the real economy has been released more obviously. But the effect of inland area has not been reflected, so the effect is more obvious than that of coastal area.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                In reality, there have been many cases, such as the fastest growth of digital economy in Chengdu and Chongqing, which has led to the rapid development of electronic information industry; Guizhou has released data dividends by using big data, and its economic growth ranks the top three in the country for six consecutive years.
            </p><br/>
            <h3>China's digital economy accounts for about 30% of GDP and has a lot of room for growth.</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                At present, China's overall digital economy is second only to the United States, ranking second in the world. However, in terms of the proportion of GDP, China is about 30%, while many developed countries are about 50%, and the United States is close to 60%. This means that there is still a lot of room for China's digital economy to grow. Gao Xinmin, vice chairman of China Internet Association and member of the National Consultative Committee of Information Technology Experts, pointed out that the next step is to develop the digital economy.
We should fully integrate industry, social life and social governance with the Internet. "From the application level, it is the integration of industry, agriculture and Internet +. We want the industry to be Internet based. Of course, there is also the Internet of social life, that is, the whole social life, we have done better, but we need to further deepen. In addition, the Internet of social governance is also very important.
            </p><br/>
            <h3>Brief comment: narrowing the "digital divide" between urban and rural areas is the top priority in developing digital economy</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                With the popularization and acceleration of rural broadband, the combination of rural and Internet is becoming closer and closer. However, the digital divide between urban and rural areas has not been bridged. For example, express delivery in rural areas, especially in remote areas, still faces the "last mile" problem; in addition to e-commerce, rural areas rarely see other forms of Internet economy; rural production and life, education, medical care, also need to be transformed through the Internet;
As a primary industry, the integration of Internet and Internet needs to be further deepened. Only by doing our best to narrow the various "digital divide", can we fully release the dividends of the digital economy.
