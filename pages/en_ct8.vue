            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                On July 31, the National Bureau of Statistics issued a new kinetic energy index for China's economic development in 2018. The results show that the new momentum with new industries, new formats and new modes as its main content is gathering rapidly, and the new momentum is growing continuously. The continuous development of digital economy represented by network economy has become an important force for the development and expansion of new momentum.
