                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yulin News Network - Yulin Daily News: "There is a red light here, and there are new problems." Recently, Xiao Cao, a staff member of the Discipline Commission of Bobai County, has just logged on to the "big data" platform and found an abnormal situation. He then clicked on the suspect page and opened it. Originally, it was a cadre of a town in Dongping Town who cheated the reservoir resettlement later support money because his identity did not meet the conditions for receiving the red light.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These problems are deeply hidden, and it is very difficult to find them by human verification." Xiao Cao said, "But by comparing big data, we can find out the problem automatically, which is very time-saving and labor-saving to supervise." Establishing a large data platform for data comparison is an innovative mode for Bobai County to re-supervise the violation of discipline in livelihood funds on the basis of the electronic dynamic supervision platform of livelihood funds pioneered by Guangxi.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huang Weidong, Standing Committee of the Discipline Commission of Bobai County and Deputy Director-General of the County Supervision Bureau, said that big data comparison involved huge amounts of data. The data needed to be compared involved in more than 25,000 public officials, more than 1.75 million application records and related information in the county, as well as 50 people's livelihood funds in 23 departments of the county. The total amount of funds is more than 6 billion yuan.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we check and compare manpower, these data are astronomical. However, using large data comparison platform, we can easily dig out all kinds of hidden "invisible" problems. "We mainly rely on the electronic dynamic supervision platform of livelihood funds to obtain the names, ID cards, addresses and other information of all public officials in the county from the relevant departments, create a new information database of public officials, and then import it into the big data comparison platform, and use scientific and technological means to compare with the county civil affairs bureau, poverty alleviation office, social security bureau, etc. The data of Finance Bureau and other departments are compared and identified one by one. Xiao Cao told me that as long as the problem does not meet the conditions for receiving, the big data platform will be the first red light, that is to say, to tell us the existence of doubtful problems.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to statistics, since 2016, Bobai County has made use of large data comparison platform to compare and find more than 2 500 hidden problems involving the collection and fraud of people's livelihood funds, involving more than 30 million yuan, providing more than 980 case clues and transferring 294 cases to the record. A batch of fraudulent and fake rural minimum living allowance, urban minimum living allowance and dangerous housing have been re-investigated and dealt with quickly and severely. Violations of discipline such as reform subsidies and post-resettlement funds of reservoirs have demonstrated the great power of anti-corruption in science and technology.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to better plug loopholes and prevent similar problems from recurring, Bobai County Disciplinary Commission found out the crux, prescribed the right remedy, organized and urged the competent departments to formulate and improve 26 effective long-term management systems of people's livelihood funds in a timely manner, and effectively shut down the power system "cage".
