                In recent years, digital economy has been continuously integrated into all fields of production and life in our society, which not only brings new industries and new lifestyles, but also brings a series of new changes to traditional industries and social life.
Recently, the reporter found in his interview in Guangxi that the deep integration of digital and traditional industries, government affairs and other fields in Guangxi has brought profound changes, while a series of emerging industries derived from digital economy are flourishing in Guangxi.
"Digital +" continues to give Guangxi high-quality economic and social development.

                With the digital terminal pointing at a box of spare parts, it completes all the steps from filling out the form to checking and then to inputting the system. This is what the reporter saw recently in the excavator factory of Guangxi Liugong Machinery Co., Ltd.
            </p><br/><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               In order to maintain the normal production of the product line, Xian Xi, an incoming inspector, said that in the past, each batch of raw materials and components not only need to be carefully inspected and filled in various paper forms, but also need to be systematically entered in and out of offices and factories.
It takes more than four hours a day to fill in forms and enter the system. And when you go back to the office to input the system data, it will affect the inspection of the factory area. Once the time is too long, it will cause backlog of the stock.
Affecting the continuous operation of production line, the pressure is enormous.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Xian Xi proudly showed reporters the handheld digital terminal and said that since the digitization transformation of excavator factory, filling in forms and inputting system can be completed with a single sweep, and all information will be synchronized to the whole system link immediately.
It not only saves more than 50% of the filling-in time and system input time every day, but also reduces the human error and leakage factors greatly and improves the efficiency of the whole production line.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Zeng Shiqiang, an inspector of excavator warehousing, believes that besides the change of working mode, the more important thing is the change of working concept. Previously, all the links in the production line were "painted firmly" and self-limiting.
For example, regardless of the quality inspection, we feel that we can rely on the last pass inspection, but only relying on the final link is unavoidable, which may eventually affect the stability of the product. Nowadays everyone is an inspector.
The operation of each link is a real-time input system. All operations can be traced back to the spirit of the digital factory.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The digital transformation of Liugong Excavator Factory is only a corner of the current integration of industry and digital economy in Guangxi. The digital transformation of industry is quietly unfolding in all parts of Guangxi.

            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Wan Zuhua, general manager of Netease Guangxi, said that Youermin's development path is one of the examples of the rise of many digital economic enterprises in the innovation center. Through the establishment of Jijian e-commerce platform for Guangxi Construction Industry Group,
Happy Doodle Logistics Platform, Jijianyun Mall Platform and other supply chain management service platforms are digitally integrated, realizing the integration of business flow, logistics, information flow and capital flow.

Government services such as "one case, one discussion" for key enterprises are also rare nationwide in terms of the three-year free office conditions provided by Nanning Netease Joint Innovation Center for digital enterprises.
It greatly reduces the cost and concerns of the development of digital start-ups.
