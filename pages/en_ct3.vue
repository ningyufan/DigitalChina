                "Overall, the overall promotion of digital China construction in 2018 has achieved remarkable results. Major tasks have been carried out in an all-round way. Key projects have been advanced in depth. Priority actions have been taken to achieve results, and the annual target tasks of national informatization development have been successfully accomplished."
On the morning of May 6, the 2nd Digital China Construction Summit opened in Fuzhou, Fujian Province. The National Network Information Office released the Digital China Construction Development Report (2018) at the main forum, which Yang Xiaowei, deputy director of the National Internet Information Office, said when interpreting the report.

                "In 2018, China's digital economy reached 31.3 trillion yuan, accounting for 34.8% of GDP. At the end of last year, the scale of Internet users was 829 million, the penetration rate of Internet was 59.6%, which was 3.8% higher than that of last year.
Electronic information manufacturing industry, software and information technology service industry, telecommunications industry, big data industry and so on have maintained relatively rapid growth. Information technology research and innovation is active. In 2018, the number of patents authorized for domestic information technology inventions reached 185,000, an increase of 10.8% over the same period last year. Yang Xiaowei said that in terms of achievements, China's informatization development capacity and overall level have been continuously improved, the development environment has been further improved, and a solid step has been taken to implement the new development concept. Informatization not only promotes the structural reform on the supply side, but also strongly supports the implementation of major reforms.

               On the other hand, the important task of building digital China is also being further promoted. From the point of view of the completion of the main indicators of the development of national information technology, the key data, including the number of patents authorized for information technology inventions, the proportion of optical fiber users to the total broadband users, the popularity of fixed broadband households, the popularity of mobile broadband users and the coverage of broadband networks in poor villages, have achieved the end of the 13th Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. At the same time, the construction of a new generation of information infrastructure has been accelerated, the ability of information technology innovation has been gradually enhanced, and the construction of data resources system has achieved remarkable results.
Digital economy fosters new momentum for development, e-government and new-type smart city construction have improved significantly, and network poverty alleviation and digital rural construction have continued to advance. For example, in the construction of data resources system, including national population, enterprise legal person, natural resources and other basic databases have been built successively. 71 departments and 32 places of the country have fully access to the national e-government foreign network and national data sharing and exchange platform. The opening of public information resources in key areas is also increasing, and the national unification in 2018. The total data of the Bureau's Data Publishing Database reached 1.055 million, with a total of 258 million visits.

At the same time, the construction of a new generation of information infrastructure has been accelerated, the ability of information technology innovation has been gradually strengthened, the construction of data resources system has achieved remarkable results, and the digital economy has fostered and strengthened new momentum for development.
The level of e-government and new-type wisdom city construction has been markedly improved, and the network poverty alleviation and digital rural construction have been promoted successively. For example, in the construction of data resources system, including national population, enterprise legal person, natural resources and other basic databases have been built successively. 71 departments and 32 places of the country have fully access to the national e-government foreign network and national data sharing and exchange platform.

               Although the "report card" is quite eye-catching, the construction of digital China in 2019 still needs to be fully promoted. Yang Xiaowei said frankly: "The innovation ability is not strong enough, the industrial ecology is not perfect; the release of digital power is not sufficient; the regional development is unbalanced, the digital divide is still large; the development environment needs to be further improved. These are the key problems to be solved. He said that this year, we will carry out pre-research on the 14th Five-Year Plan for Informatization, and optimize the innovative ecology, accelerate the construction of new infrastructure, promote the innovative development of digital economy, focus on narrowing the digital divide, promote the development of e-government and benefit the people with information.
We should strengthen the capacity-building of network security and deepen open cooperation.
