                Last weekend, the Internet Hospital of Foshan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine was officially launched. It is not only the first Internet Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Guangdong Province, but also the only pilot project in the province.
                Internet Hospital with Integrated Service of Drug Distribution. More than a month ago, the Suqian Branch of Jingdong Internet Hospital announced that it was officially launched and that the medical insurance system of Jingdong and Suqian was connected.
                This is the first time that medical e-commerce platform has realized medical insurance payment.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Since last year, good policies such as "Opinions on Promoting the Development of Internet + Medical Health" have been launched intensively, and the inclusion of Internet medical services into medical insurance has become the biggest highlight.
                It can be said that the industry has broken the ice, and the development of Internet hospitals has entered a new stage.

                Brush the medical insurance and take the medicine from 30 minutes to 3 minutes.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                On the day of the launch of the Internet Hospital of Foshan Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, patient Zhu Laobo tasted fresh immediately. He usually goes to Buddhist traditional Chinese medicine for a second visit. It takes him more than 30 minutes to get the medicine.
                On the same day, after getting the prescription from the Internet hospital platform, Zhu Laobo went to the out-of-hospital pharmacy for 3-5 minutes and brushed the medical insurance card to get the medicine.

                "Our first step now is the circulation of prescriptions and payment of medical insurance for chronic diseases in outpatient clinics," Liu, president of Foshan Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said to reporters, "I believe that the second step will expand to a wider range of slow doors and Mentor.
                The next step will be open to all patients who have been referred. In theory, the future may not require a doctor's hands-on solution, patients and customers can be realized online.

                According to reports, the Internet Hospital of Foshan Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital is the first pilot project of Foshan Medical Insurance Prescription Sharing Convenient Service Platform. Liao Jieyuan, the platform's contractor, chairman and CEO of Micromedicine Group, said that
                The Internet Hospital of Foshan Chinese medicine hospital will continue to deepen its services in the future, and build it into a "Internet plus Chinese medicine" convenient service platform and a "medical insurance" data exchange platform in Foshan.

               Release of Primary Diagnosis and Treatment Needs to Promote Medical Insurance Payment
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The new round of medical and health system reform is entering the deep water area. Internet plus medical care has been placed high hopes. However, the failure to achieve medical insurance payment has always been the "heart disease" of the industry. According to Liao Xinbo, former deputy director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Health,
                If Internet hospitals want to survive, they must rely on the recognition of payment system. Last September, the National Health Commission issued the "Internet Medical Management Measures (Trial)" and "Internet Hospital Management Measures (Trial)".
                "Telemedicine Service Management Standards (Trial Implementation)" three important documents in the field of Internet health care. At that time, Lu Qingjun, director of the National Telemedicine and Internet Medical Center and the Telemedicine Center of the Sino-Japanese Hospital, revealed that:
                The State Medical Insurance Bureau is formulating the price guidelines for Internet medical services. Telemedicine and other Internet medical services are expected to be included in medical insurance.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                In 2016, Sichuan Medical Insurance brought Sichuan Micromedicine Internet Hospital into the fixed point of medical insurance, and took the lead in making online payment in China. Then, Internet hospitals in other places came in succession.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               As a Micromedicine group, Zhang Guimin, general manager of the company's brand public relations department, shared his experience with reporters. Compared with the abundant high-quality medical resources of "Beishengguang", the western region represented by Sichuan has a more urgent need for Internet diagnosis and treatment.
                In more than a year, Sichuan Micromedicine Internet Hospital has established cooperation with several local tertiary general hospitals. Through the interconnection with Wuzhen Internet Hospital, Sichuan Micromedicine Internet Hospital introduced the national high quality medical resources into Sichuan.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                With the increasing demand of the 90 million Sichuan Sichuan people's Internet diagnosis and treatment and higher demands for payment, in 2016, the Sichuan Provincial Health Planning Commission, the development and Reform Commission and the people's social office issued the guidance on speeding up the Internet + medical and health services.
                At the same time, the policy of Internet + health care service price, medical insurance reimbursement and other supporting policies will be launched.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Cheng Lifeng, founding partner of Baikang Medical Company in Guangdong Province, also said that the realization of medical insurance payment in Internet hospitals is a relatively complex issue, which needs to be regulated in many key aspects such as pricing, supervision and settlement. Of course, a single platform like the Internet Hospital of Foshan Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital.
                It belongs to the extension of our hospital's medical service line. It is relatively easy to operate such an Internet hospital into medical insurance. "If it is similar to the platform-based Internet hospital facing the national patient and doctor services, docking medical insurance is a huge project, but it is also the direction and goal of the industry's efforts."
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Internet Hospital Access Business Insurance is highly expected
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                In addition to health insurance, more and more internet medical companies are seeking breakthroughs at the payment side and cooperating further with insurance companies. Commercial insurance is also regarded as the ultimate goal of the business model of Internet hospitals.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Like micro-medicine group, Chunyu doctor and peace and health, these three industry leaders have plans to connect insurance in the rapid development.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Zhang Guimin told reporters that "micro-medical insurance, one of the business lines of micro-medicine, has built an open Internet health insurance platform, and has carried out multi-level business cooperation with more than 30 institutions such as human health, public security insurance and Taikang Life Insurance.
                In areas where high-quality medical resources are concentrated, we have signed contracts with 25 hospitals and built a direct and quick compensation system for interconnection with medical data. For example, two years ago, China's first Internet insurance company, Mass Security Insurance and Micromedicine, launched its first ACO product in China.——
                "Family Guardianship" Internet Hospital Outpatient Insurance. Cost settlement is 40% self-payment, and the remaining 60% is paid directly by commercial insurance.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                From the perspective of internet medical groups, most of their "internet medical + insurance" refers to the Caesar model of the United States, but in the background, the United States is a country dominated by commercial insurance, which accounts for more than 40% of the total medical expenditure.
                In contrast, the proportion of total medical expenditure in China's commercial health insurance is only 1.4%, and the rest is covered by basic medical insurance. Why do Internet medical companies still have opportunities when the coverage of basic medical insurance in China is so high? In the view of Liao Jieyuan, chairman and CEO of Micromedicine,
                This is mainly due to the inadequacy of the existing medical insurance function in China.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Cheng adds that the Caesar model not only cooperates with hospitals, but also contracts with physician groups to determine the price of medical services, and allocates a certain proportion of premiums to physician groups, with insured persons receiving services from contracted physicians. This reflects the personal value of doctors. In this sense,
                Internet hospitals can play a larger role for doctors, and the competitive advantage of commercial insurance is also reflected.
            </p><br/>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                At the same time, with the growing maturity of internet medical services centered on families and individuals, traditional insurance companies have begun to explore Internet medical and health services. For example, Taikang Life Co., Ltd. jointly launched the "Doctor's Care" safeguard plan. "In the future, online payment and commercial insurance direct payment will be a major direction of development."
                Zhang Guimin said so. (Reporter Li Jie)
