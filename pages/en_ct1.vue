                After intelligent transformation, the vacuum cleaner workshop realizes "light-off operation". With the assistance of digital platform, the production efficiency of traditional sheet metal manufacturing is improved by 30%. The driverless vehicle relies on the sensing technology of Internet of Things.
                Completed the diversion, overtaking, deceleration and other series of operations... Reporters recently interviewed in eastern cities of China found that the digital economy has sprung up and is deeply restructuring Made in China.

                In the workshop of the largest precise sheet metal manufacturer in East China, the whole process from sales order to product production, storage and delivery can be tracked in real time through digital platform.
                Wangcainan, the head of the enterprise, told reporters that after the intelligent transformation of the factory, the production efficiency has increased by more than 30%, and the rate of product defect has been controlled within 1%.
                The transformation of this enterprise from "manufacturing" to "intelligent manufacturing" is a vivid portrayal of the upgrading of traditional manufacturing industry in China's digital economy. Digital economy refers to the use of digital information and knowledge as factors of production and modern information networks as space for development and activities.
                The effective use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is an important driving force for productivity growth and economic structure optimization.

                According to Wang Qinmin, director of the National E-government Expert Committee, industrial digitalization is an important part of the digital economy. "When digital resources merge with traditional resources such as land, capital and labor, new advanced productivity comes into being."
                Relying on the digital economy, a large number of traditional manufacturing factories in China are quietly transforming. In the "Vacuum Cleaner Intelligent Production Workshop" of a household appliances enterprise in Jiangsu Province, the products are taken out by the manipulator and transferred to the operation area through the pipeline. The finished products are put into storage and put into the final assembly.
                It realizes the separation of man and machine and the operation of turning off lights. Relevant person in charge of the company said that more than 95% of the equipment in the enterprise has been digitized, and some production workshops have established intelligent manufacturing mode.

                In July, the future science and technology city project of Caohu Development Zone in Xiangcheng, Suzhou is advancing in the summer. The project is built by leading enterprises in the domestic robotics industry. It covers R&amp;D and manufacturing of industrial robots, service robots, special robots and other products. The annual output value is expected to reach 1.5 billion yuan after putting into production.
                Qu Daokui, chairman of the company, said that after the completion of the Science and Technology City in the future, it will drive the agglomeration of the whole industrial chain of robotics and intelligent manufacturing in the Yangtze River Delta region of China, promote the industrial upgrading of surrounding enterprises, and realize technological innovation and intensive development. Unmanned driving is more accessible than the technology city of the future, which still needs time.
                At the Digital Economic Summit of the Yangtze River Delta (Suzhou) held in Xiangcheng District of Suzhou City, Cao Xudong, the founder of the initial speed technology of autopilot enterprises, demonstrated their latest technology of driverless driving. In the traffic flow, the driverless vehicle fluently demonstrates the commands of acceleration, deceleration, Lane change, etc. Even the difficult operations such as overtaking are well accomplished.

            "The development of digital economy, represented by big data and artificial intelligence, will not only refresh the industrial map, but also subvert people's lifestyle and inject strong impetus into high-quality economic development." Gu Haidong, Secretary of the CPC Committee of Xiangcheng District of Suzhou City, said.

                In the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, the scale of China's digital economy continues to expand.
                According to the White Paper on China's Digital Economic Development and Employment (2019) published by the China Institute of Information and Communication Industry, the scale of China's digital economy reached 31.3 trillion yuan in 2018, accounting for 34.8% of GDP. Despite the breakthrough of digital economy, the development of digital economy in China's three industrial convergence still shows an unbalanced pattern.
                There is a reverse osmosis trend of 321 production. Some experts believe that the current tertiary industry digital economy development is relatively advanced, while the first and second industry digital economy is relatively lagging behind, and there is a "cold, empty and hot" seedling. In this regard, Sun Ke, director of the Department of Digital Economy Research, Institute of Policy and Economics, China Academy of Information and Communication, suggested that industrial ecology be optimized.
                Open up the industrial chain, data chain and financial chain, promote the networking, digitalization and intelligent transformation of the real economy, promote the benign interaction between innovation elements and market applications, and build a new ecology for the development of digital economy through financial innovation of primary, secondary and tertiary industries, large and medium-sized enterprises.

                Chen Yu, deputy dean of the School of Economics and Management of Tsinghua University and director of the Internet Development and Governance Research Center, said that cross-border cooperation between industry, University and research could be promoted, and a technological innovation system with enterprises as the main body, market-oriented and integration of industry, University and research could be built.
