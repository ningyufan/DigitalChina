               Out of the village, through a long-distance connection, the village doctor in Changjia Town, Gaoqing, Shandong Province, sits in the bathroom and can consult the villagers with experts from 301 Hospital, Beijing, 400 kilometers away.

                Telemedicine is an important part of the construction of Gaoqing Smart City. This small and medium-sized town of Shandong, with a population of less than 400,000, uses advanced technology such as Internet of Things, Big Data and Cloud Computing to enable urban management, and strives to achieve good governance, benefit the people and prosperity.

                Smart cities used to concentrate on the first-and second-tier cities in China, as well as some of the more developed third-tier cities. Nowadays, more and more county-level cities like Gaoqing are devoting themselves to the upsurge of building smart cities. While resolving the "big city disease", smart cities extend to counties to help grassroots solve the development problems.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                In recent years, China's smart city construction is in the ascendant. Tang Shenghong, vice president of the People's Network Research Institute, said that according to incomplete statistics, at present, about 700 cities in China have proposed or are building smart cities, accounting for 70% of the total number of smart cities proposed by the world in the same period, in 100% of cities above the deputy provincial level, 93% of cities above the prefecture level and some cities at the county level.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               Experts believe that the construction of digital China focuses on the county level. In China's governance structure, county-level administrative units connect cities and towns with the vast rural areas, and are in a unique position and key node to connect urban and rural areas. They are the important foundation for economic development, people's livelihood Protection and stability maintenance.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               However, there are still many shortcomings in some counties and cities in China, including low efficiency of government services, lack of education and medical resources, and low-end industrial structure. Aiming at these painful points of development, many county-level cities regard the construction of smart cities as a solution.

                What is wisdom in a county? Yang Xueshan, a part-time professor at Peking University, believes that one of the characteristics of county wisdom city construction is "concrete and meticulous". Take Gao Qing's Intelligent Medicine as an example. For diseases that can not be solved locally, we used to go to Jinan and Beijing for help. Intelligent medicine remotely introduces the things that need to go out. Through big data analysis, the main diseases of Gaoqing people, the ability and deficiency of local hospitals, remote matching hospitals and doctors, this process reflects "wisdom".

                Yao Jian-kui, chief engineer of Huawei Enterprise BG China Intelligent City, said that the telemedicine system they built for Gao Qing is divided into five levels. Gao Qing is in the third level. There are medical resources at the national and provincial levels, and there are service objects at the township and village levels. All resources are pooled on the same platform, and high-quality medical resources at each level can be obtained. It extends downward to the grassroots masses.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Not only the development of smart medicine, Gao Qing has built more than 20 innovative applications, such as integrated grid, whole process supervision of hazardous chemicals, smart policing, smart city management and emergency response of urban waterlogging, through the construction of eLTE broadband cluster network and narrowband Internet of Things, covering the whole county, and has initially achieved precision, refinement and cross-sectoral. Urban management, improve the level of urban and rural governance.

               Enter July, usher in the flood season. In the past, when rainstorms happened in flood season, Gao Qing organized more than 20 people to patrol the waterlogging-prone spots in county towns and sent special people to watch at River gates. Even so, waterlogging often occurred. Now, under the command of the "intelligent brain" of the waterlogging emergency management system, the monitoring information of the Internet of Things at all waterlogging-prone points and gate points in the county and all relevant video sources are transmitted to the command center to realize the omni-directional on-site perception, data sharing of various departments, and resources can be quickly allocated without dispatching a large number of human patrols and guards.

                With the achievements of smart city construction, Gaoqing, a small county town located on the Yellow River, won the prize of city digital transformation at the 8th Global Smart City Expo in Barcelona in 2018 and the best mobile innovation prize of smart city at the World Mobile Communication Congress in 2019.

                Gaoqing County is a microcosm of the wisdom city of exploring roads in China's county-level cities. In recent years, the seeds of "wisdom" have blossomed all over China's vast counties. Fenghuang County of Hunan Province has introduced 5G technology into many fields, such as wisdom couplet, wisdom tourism, wisdom government affairs, etc. Visitors can experience VR panoramic view of the ancient city of Phoenix. More than 300 achievements have been made in the construction of wisdom city in the old estuary of Hubei Province, and wisdom has been developed in many fields, such as government affairs, city management, emergency command, underground pipeline network and people's livelihood care.

                Experts believe that the construction of county wisdom city is not simply informationization, but to let the county's economic and social development "live, think", the core is to use technical means to break the bottleneck constraints in County development, so as to optimize the county's economic development, social governance, public services and so on.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               In China, there are both towns and villages in the county. Experts warn that the construction of county-level smart cities should pay special attention to urban-rural coordination. Shan Zhiguang, director of the Ministry of Informatization and Industrial Development of the National Information Center, said that county wisdom city development should focus on promoting rural revitalization, such as improving the level of informatization of agricultural equipment, strengthening the monitoring, early warning and publication of agricultural information, digitalizing agricultural production, strengthening the application of remote sensing and Internet of Things. Exhibit wisdom meteorology to improve meteorological service ability for agriculture, etc.
