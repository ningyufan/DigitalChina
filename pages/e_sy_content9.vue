                At the 2018 World Mobile Congress recently held, the three major operators in China's mobile communication field and several enterprises in the industry chain have issued the latest 5G deployment plan, clearly realizing the formal commercial use of 5G by 2020.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                According to the plan of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China's 5G test will be divided into two steps: the first step is from 2016 to the end of 2018, which is the 5G technology R&amp;D test, the main goal is to participate in supporting the formulation of 5G international standards; the second step is from 2018 to the end of 2020.
The main objective of the 5G product R&amp;D test is to carry out 5G pre-commercial test. According to this timetable, the industry agrees that China is expected to achieve 5G pre-commerce in 2019 and large-scale formal commerce in 2020.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Lu Yimin, general manager of China Unicom Network Communications Group Co., Ltd., said that in the 5G field, China Unicom has launched 5G scale tests in 16 cities, and will demonstrate and test its business application in 2019, and plan to formally commercialize in 2020.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Shang Bing, chairman of China Mobile Communications Group Co., Ltd., said that China Mobile will vigorously promote 5G scale test and application demonstration, strive for scale test in 2018, achieve pre-commercial in 2019 and achieve full commercial in 2020.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                In order to achieve the goal of officially commercializing 5G by 2020, the commercial pace of the whole industrial chain is accelerating. Especially the 5G independent networking standard has just been frozen recently, which means that the first stage of full-function standardization of 5G has been completed and released, and has entered the stage of full-scale industrial sprint.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                China Unicom said that its 5G network will be based on independent networking standards, focusing on enhancing mobile broadband in the early stage, continuing to maintain China Unicom's network speed advantages in the 3G and 4G era, providing high-definition video, virtual reality/augmented reality game entertainment, car-borne video, audio and video, and so on.
Intelligent home provides all-round network support for large traffic and high bandwidth applications. In the follow-up, we will actively introduce low-latency, high-reliability and mass machine-based communication technologies to support the digital transformation of vertical industries such as vehicle networking and industrial internet, in combination with technological standards and the development process of ecosystems.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                During the World Mobile Congress in 2018, China Mobile jointly launched "5G SA (Independent Networking) Initiative" with global partners such as Datang Telecom, Ericsson, Huawei, Intel and Nokia, aiming at promoting independent networking from standard to real commercialization and promoting end-to-end product maturity as soon as possible.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                During the conference, Yang Xiaowei, deputy director of CNN Information Office, and Shanghai Mobile Technologists conducted the first 5G independent end-to-end system holographic video calls in the world. For the first time, 5G independent end-to-end system technology was used in the calls, which marked a breakthrough in 5G independent network technology and the development of 5G industry was accelerating.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Earlier, China Mobile also released 12 5G innovations to the outside world. Li Zhengmao, Vice President of China Mobile Communications Group Co., Ltd., formally awarded licences to three open laboratories in Jiangsu, Hubei and Guizhou. At present, China Mobile 5G Joint Innovation Center has 224 industrial partners, 14 open laboratories have been established in the United States, Sweden and China, and dozens of 5G innovation projects have been carried out by joint partners.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Shang Bing said that China Mobile should plan 5G network with the goal of independent networking, promote the cloud deployment of 5G network, accelerate the end-to-end maturity of 5G industry, relying on 5G joint innovation center and 5G industry research institute, develop innovative platforms and R&amp;D applications such as smart cities, vehicle networking, industrial Internet, etc.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               China Telecom released "China Telecom 5G Technology White Paper" the day before the 2018 World Mobile Congress, which is the first white paper issued by global operators to comprehensively expound 5G technology viewpoints and overall strategy.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Liu Aili, general manager of China Telecom Group Limited, said that China Telecom will make every effort to promote 5G development from two aspects of technological innovation and industrial cooperation. As far as technological innovation is concerned, by the end of June 2018, China Telecom has led 31 projects and tasks of 5G international standards and submitted 457 international manuscripts.
190 technical patents have been applied for, of which 143 have been granted patent protection. In terms of industrial cooperation, China Telecom launched the construction of 5G innovation demonstration network in six cities such as Xiongan, and opened all 5G pilot base stations in December 2017. In February 2018, the National Development and Reform Commission formally approved China Telecom to carry out 5G scale construction and application demonstration projects in 12 cities such as Beijing.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The 5G terminal product guide issued by China Mobile during the conference shows that the first batch of 5G chips will be launched at the end of 2018, the first batch of 5G terminals will be launched in the first quarter of 2019, and the 5G smartphones will be launched in the third quarter of 2019. China Mobile also has 28 members of the 5G Terminal Pioneer Program, including 6 mainstream chip companies and 13 mainstream terminal companies.
Five component enterprises and four instrument enterprises signed a memorandum of cooperation to accelerate the development of 5G terminal industry and incubation products.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Obviously, according to this schedule, terminal manufacturers also need to speed up. Xu Zhijun, Chairman-in-Office of Huawei, said that Huawei would launch 5G commercial system based on independent networking standards on March 30, 2019, Kirin chips supporting 5G in 2019 and smartphones supporting 5G in June, 2019.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Kristiano Amon, president of Qualcomm, also said that the 5G data terminal will be released in some markets in December, and the first smartphones with full 5G functions will be launched by the affiliated factories with Qualcomm in March and April next year.
