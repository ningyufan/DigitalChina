                Guangxi will rely on the accelerating construction of China-ASEAN information port and promote the interconnection between China and ASEAN, said Chairman Yang of the Bureau of Data Development of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on September 29.
Develop China-ASEAN big data industry, and strive to promote China-ASEAN industries in all fields to digitize.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Xi Yang made the above remarks at a press conference held in Nanning. He disclosed that the Master Plan for the Construction of China-ASEAN Information Port was formally approved by the state earlier this year.
The construction of China-ASEAN information port has been launched in an all-round way.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The China-ASEAN information port, jointly constructed by China and ASEAN countries, is gradually forming a China-ASEAN information hub with Guangxi as its fulcrum. At present, China and ASEAN have more than 10 optical cable connections.
The Asia-Pacific direct international submarine optical cable has been built and put into operation. The cross-border optical cable systems between China, Vietnam and Myanmar have been expanded and fully opened for use. Bilateral cooperation has been carried out to build the Beidou Foundation Enhancement System.
Beidou Industrial Demonstration Park and Data Center were set up together. China and ASEAN have also established a number of bilateral technology transfer centers and set up a number of information service platforms such as China-ASEAN technical standards and ASEAN small language assisted translation.
Jointly carry out activities such as technological innovation, standard-setting and technical cooperation.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Xi Yang introduced that this year, Guangxi will accelerate the development of a new generation of electronic information technology industry, promote the construction of China-ASEAN information port planning projects, and promote the support of a number of key enterprises in the field of large data to enter ASEAN countries.
We will focus on cooperation in smart cities, e-government and call center aggregation platforms, and strengthen information and communication cooperation with ASEAN by promoting key enterprises to build data centers, CORS stations and other infrastructure in ASEAN countries.
At the same time, we should scientifically plan the development of big data industry and promote the construction of a number of parks (bases) such as Nanning Wuxiang Ocean-going Big Data Industrial Park, Huawei (ASEAN) Big Data Center and Qinzhou Huawei Digital Town.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Xiyang said that digital cultural industries such as literary creation, games, television, video and audio are popular in ASEAN countries. As one of the provinces and regions with the largest number of students from ASEAN, Guangxi will make full use of this advantage.
We support ASEAN students to start their own businesses in related fields, form an incubator through the "Internet +" industry, and actively promote the existing traditional formats of China ASEAN. (Feng Yumin)
