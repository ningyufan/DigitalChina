                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yulin News Network-Yulin Daily News after five months of trial operation, the upgraded Bobai County People's Livelihood Funds Big Data Supervision Platform was re-launched recently, which is the first upgrade of the platform since its completion at the end of 2011, providing a more solid supervision guarantee for Bobai County's poverty alleviation and fortification work.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, Bobai County has continuously strengthened the supervision of people's livelihood funds and projects, promoted the standardized operation of funds and projects, and endeavoured to embed the advantages of information technology into the supervision and discipline work in the field of poverty alleviation. At the end of 2011, Bobai County took the lead in establishing a livelihood fund supervision platform covering county, town and village levels, which integrates three platforms and ten functions: business, supervision and publicity.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, Bobai County upgraded and filed the supervision platform of livelihood funds according to the principles of pragmatism, utility and efficiency, and added the supervision of livelihood funds in advance, the supervision of poverty alleviation projects, Wechat End and "two". Five major functions and sections, such as online real-time evaluation and 3D display of honest and clean government education base, are to make public 60 items of livelihood fund information totaling 8.5 billion yuan in the county, and conduct dynamic and effective supervision so that the platform can become a sharp tool for supervision and discipline, a platform for cadres'honest and clean government education, and a yardstick for implementing responsibility assessment.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data is the foundation, operation is the key, and effectiveness is the standard for platform upgrade. It is understood that during the trial operation stage of the platform upgrade, using the platform's pre-supervision function, the fund for early warning and discovery of problems was nearly 3 million yuan; through platform reporting and comparative analysis, 53 questionable questions were found in the implementation and management of poverty alleviation projects, 597 clues were found to illegally receive beneficiary subsidies, and 68 cases were transferred to file for effective prevention. Stop "running, risking, dripping and leaking" of poverty alleviation funds.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Upgraded and upgraded large data monitoring platform for livelihood funds will more effectively enhance the depth and breadth of supervision, standardize the operation of livelihood policies, help the county to overcome poverty, let cadres work in the'sunshine'and eliminate corruption in the field of poverty alleviation."
