                The digital economy will become an important driving force for employment growth in China. Economic Reference News reporter learned exclusively from China Information and Communication Research Institute on November 11 that China's employment population in the field of digital economy is expected to exceed 200 million by 2020. Among them, the employment potential of the secondary industry digital economy is huge, and the digitization of traditional industries will become an important channel to absorb employment.

                 "The development of digital economy not only promotes employment upgrading, but also brings new employment. Especially the digital transformation of traditional industries has become an important channel for China to absorb employment.
                 Sun Ke, director of the Digital Economy Research Department of the Chinese Academy of Communications and Communications, told the Economic Reference that the potential of the digital economy to unleash the huge employment market lies in two aspects.
                 First, the transformation of old and new momentum creates huge employment space. Research shows that for every 100 employees in the digital economy, 72 are upgraded to the original employment and 28 are new jobs.
                 Second, the flexible employment brought about by the digital economy has developed rapidly, and its proportion in employment has increased rapidly.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                 As far as the industry distribution is concerned, the digital economy of the secondary industry has great potential to absorb employment in the future. According to the data of ICT, preliminary estimates show that the number of people engaged in the digital transformation of the secondary industry in 2017 is 50.54 million.
                 It accounts for 22.4% of the total employment in the secondary industry. The potential of digitized transformation to absorb labor force has not been fully tapped. The digital transformation of the tertiary industry absorbs about 12.16 million workers.
                 It accounts for 34.3% of the total employment in the tertiary industry, and is the main field in which the digital economy absorbs employment.

                According to the introduction, the employment growth in the digital economy is accelerating and new forms of employment are emerging. But at the same time, there is a big gap in the supply of digital talents.

                The problems of employment service and employment management system adapting to the mobility of workers and the diversification of employment modes are still outstanding.
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
               To speed up the cultivation of new employment opportunities in the digital economy, Sun Ke suggested that first, we should cultivate and strengthen the new model of the digital economy and create more employment opportunities. For example, to develop and expand new industries such as artificial intelligence and big data.
               Promote the deep integration of digital economy with the first, second and third industries, promote the extension and upgrading of industrial chain, and promote more new jobs. Secondly, we should use digital technology to upgrade the level of employment services and create a more efficient labor market.
               We will support local governments in building intelligent employment service platforms and promote efficient and accurate online and offline docking of employment information services. Third, we should strengthen the labor security of flexible employees and improve the quality of employment. For example,
               We will explore the establishment of new labor relations, social security models adapting to flexible employment, and accelerate the reform of the social security system. (Reporter Guo Qian)
