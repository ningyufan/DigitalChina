                In recent years, the level of digitalization, networking and intellectualization of China's real economy has been rising. From the interconnection of people to the interconnection of everything, from massive data to artificial intelligence, from living consumption to production and manufacturing, China's digital economy is growing rapidly. The White Paper on China's Digital Economic Development and Employment (2019) shows that in 2018, the scale of China's digital economy reached 31.3 trillion yuan, accounting for 34.8% of GDP, which has become an important force to promote high-quality development.

                At present, the digital technology supporting the development of digital economy is becoming more and more mature. As a factor of production, big data has gradually penetrated into the whole process of social production, and has been developing towards comprehensive and deep intelligence through the network and platform carrier. Digital economy has profoundly changed the mode of production and business of traditional economy, and its characteristics of innovation, efficiency, inclusiveness and openness conform to the connotation of high-quality development. More importantly, the digital economy drives the digital transformation and injects new technology and new industry genes into the high-quality development. China's economy is becoming more and more digital, drawing more and more new momentum from the digital economy. Economic activities based on digital industrialization and the theme of industrial digitalization can promote the competitiveness of traditional industries, promote the deep integration of industries, and promote the economic development of China to achieve three major changes.
            </p>
            <p>
               First, digitization helps to improve the quality of products and services and promote quality change. China's traditional manufacturing mode of production is relatively backward, the ability of independent innovation is weak, and the overall quality of products is not high. Digital transformation will change the R&amp;D and production process of traditional manufacturing industry and gradually build a digital supply chain. Taking the manufacturing sector as an example, through the analysis of a large number of data generated in the production process, the production process parameters can be further optimized, and the possible problems can be predicted, so as to improve the quality of products and services.
            </p>
            <p>
               Secondly, digitization helps to reduce market transaction costs and promote efficiency change. With the development and application of digital technology, it is possible to reduce transaction costs dramatically, promote market clearance better, and realize effective resource docking between supply and demand sides. With the full penetration of digital technology into the marketing, service, production, research and development of manufacturing industry, the digital transformation of key industries is further accelerated, which promotes the overall improvement of TFP in traditional industries such as light industry, textile, machinery and building materials. According to the preliminary statistics of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, among the 305 intelligent manufacturing demonstration projects, the digital transformation has increased the average production efficiency by 37.6%, the average energy utilization rate by 16.1%, and the average operation cost by 21.2%.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thirdly, digitalization helps to accelerate the cultivation of new momentum for growth and promote dynamic change. The new round of scientific and technological revolution brings more intense scientific and technological competition. Only when the traditional factor-driven transformation into innovation-driven, will there be inexhaustible impetus for high-quality development. Digital technology itself is an innovative result of the scientific and technological revolution, and innovations in different ways are realized by digitalization. New momentum based on data-driven is increasingly becoming the main force of economic development. For example, digitization has also spawned a number of dynamic new models, new formats and new industries. For example, the current exploration of digital transformation at the enterprise level has effectively promoted management innovation, business model innovation, marketing innovation and brand innovation.

               It is a long-term and strategic plan of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to strengthen the digital economy, build digital China and promote the deep integration of informatization and industrialization. The Central Economic Work Conference held at the end of last year and this year's government work report have proposed to improve the new digital infrastructure, deepen R&amp;D and application of big data and artificial intelligence, speed up the promotion of "Internet+" in various industries and fields, as well as build an industrial Internet platform, expand "Intelligence+" and transform it into a manufacturing industry. Requirements and measures for type upgrade and empowerment. Generally speaking, facing a new round of technological revolution, speeding up the process of industrial digitalization is of great significance to promote China's industry to move towards the middle and high end of the global value chain and foster new momentum.
