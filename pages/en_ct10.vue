            <h3>Building a Smart City Platform is of vital importance</h3>
            <p>
                As a comprehensive, complex, technical and professional social system engineering, the construction of smart cities has brought profound changes and adjustments to the regional administration, social governance, economic operation, improvement of people's livelihood and urban and rural construction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, at the "Huawei County Smart City Summit and Gaoqing Live Meeting of 2019" held in Gaoqing County, Zibo City, Shandong Province, people in the industry believed that with the acceleration of the construction of smart cities, the construction of county smart cities has become an important starting point. Among them, the platform construction of smart city is very important. It is the "base" to support the construction of smart city and promote the construction of digital economy.
            </p>
            <p>
               On the conference site, Lu Qi, vice president of Huawei Enterprise BG, believed that in order to build a new type of smart city, first of all, we need to build a strong cloud + Internet of Things + AI digital base to form the city's intelligent brain, while aggregating industry partners and applications; secondly, we need to build an open platform, build a cloud platform aggregation ecology. Realize the platform + ecological mode of operation, so that smart city can become an important booster and catalyst for the development of new industries and new formats. Thirdly, innovate and practice the business model, and realize the sustainable development of smart city through the use of social resources.
            </p>
            <p>
               Yang Xueshan, former vice-minister of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and part-time professor of Peking University, said that building a county-level smart city requires a unified software system centered on interoperability, so as to truly achieve uninterrupted collaboration, so that everything can work together. At the same time, there should also be a logical system for data collection and use, clarifying data sources, data ownership, and who can use the data. More importantly, we should enhance our capacity to adapt to the new management model and technological environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, technological, institutional and mode innovation is also the "necessary option" for building a smart city. "Technological innovation, institutional innovation and mode innovation are needed. Technological innovation is a joint effort of business personnel, management agencies, enterprises and technical support forces to make technological innovation, "said Yang Xueshan. A unified software and data system based on Interoperability requires technological innovation, including data.

            <h3>County wisdom city construction will become an important focus</h3>
            <p>
                County governments connect cities and towns with the vast countryside. The construction of smart county towns is an indispensable node for the realization of digital China, and plays an increasingly prominent role in promoting the transformation and upgrading of county economy. Participants said that the key point of future construction of smart cities in China is how to use innovative elements to achieve the popularization and practice of smart cities in County areas. Developing smart cities in county areas is an important work in future construction of smart cities in China.
            </p>
            <p>
               Chai Min, Vice President of Donghua Software Company and COO of Donghua Smart City Group, pointed out that with the construction of digital government and the rise of digital China to the national development strategy, the construction of smart cities in county areas shows huge demand and vast investment space. Moreover, the county region hopes to boost the development of the new economic form such as the "Internet +" and the digital economy through the start of the smart city in the county area, and promote the quality and efficiency of the county's regional economy with the help of the easterly tide of digital tide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lu Qi said that the county government links cities and towns with the vast countryside and is in a unique position and development node below urban and rural areas. It is an important basis for economic development, people's livelihood Protection and stability maintenance. To achieve rural revitalization, urban and rural overall development, and the construction of digital China, the key work is still in the county-level administrative region.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shan Zhiguang, director of the Ministry of Informatization and Industrial Development of the National Information Center, said that smart cities use smart technology to rebuild and rebuild cities, optimize and rebuild County development, and county wisdom city construction needs to pay attention to the following three aspects.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, respect the law of county development. We should coordinate the three major structures of space, scale and industry, the three major layout of production, life and ecology, and the three main bodies of government, society and citizens. At the same time, we should strengthen the construction and functional integration of the digital platform of urban management to improve people's livelihood management and social governance capabilities. The core of county wisdom city construction is to use technology to form an inverted mechanism to make County Economic and social development, governance structure and public layout more reasonable and optimized, and to use technology to achieve county reform and development and promote its continuous wisdom upgrading.
            </p>
            <p>
               Secondly, smart city system is complex and systematic, which requires overall planning and layout. The blueprint should be able to guide the development work in the next five to ten years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thirdly, there must be a sustainable dynamic mechanism and a long-term model. It is relatively easy to build systems, platforms and applications only. By building smart cities, we can drive smart industries, promote the development of digital economy, promote economic and social development to high-quality growth, and realize the transformation of new and old kinetic energy. This process is not simple technology application, but must form a sustainable dynamic mechanism and long-term model.
             </p>
            <p>
                Shan Zhiguang emphasized that the wisdom county is to let everyone living in the county and city fully enjoy the benefits of science and technology and the beauty of life, instead of forcibly transforming everyone into netizens, not to rigidly label every system and corner of society with wisdom. Wisdom, like air and sunshine, should enable people to enjoy the quality of life it brings freely and everywhere.
             </p>
            <h3>Building Operational Capability of Smart City</h3>
            <p>
                Intelligent city construction requires not only high level of planning and technology, but also high level of operation and service. "The innovation and practice of business model should be carried out in the construction of smart cities" has become the consensus of the participants. They believe that smart cities should be built and developed according to the industrialized business model that can be operated, replicated and promoted.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Constructing the operational capacity of a new type of smart city, through the use of social resources to participate in the construction of smart city, so as to achieve the sustainable development of smart city," Lu Qi pointed out that from the perspective of urban managers, the new type of smart city needs to be oriented to solve various problems arising in the process of urbanization, such as traffic congestion. Blockage, environmental pollution and so on. From the point of view of development path and rhythm, the construction of a new type of intelligent city should have long-term planning, and adhering to the idea of "easy first, difficult first, urgent first", we should effectively solve the problems that the people urgently need and implement them step by step. Such development goals put forward greater requirements for the technology network, and require intelligent iteration and intelligent delay. Ability to exhibit.
            </p>
            <p>
               Cui Yudong, Director of Standing Committee of Gaoqing County People's Congress and Commander of Wisdom Gaoqing Construction Command, pointed out that "building a smart city with all departments, all coordination and all links is neither a general department nor an ordinary enterprise, nor can it be realized and completed only with funds and technology." We must give full play to the government's ability of overall planning, dispatching and resource integration, and promote the organic connection and integration of information technology and regional resource demand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cui Yudong pointed out that according to the principles of industrial intelligence, intelligent industrialization and integration of production and city, the advantages of new infrastructure and multi-network integration at county level should be brought into play to provide scenarios and environments for the landing application of high-quality resources, superior strength and 5G artificial intelligence. In addition, according to the actual situation and needs of different parts of the county, tailor-made personality building is carried out to provide local governments at the county level with the overall construction and operation of smart cities, as well as the deployment of cloud modules and back-end cloud services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cui Yudong emphasized that "aggregation industry alliance, operation company and other forces should tap and release the value power of networking, digitalization and intellectualization. With the help of security, reliability and credibility of digital identity, advanced technology applications such as block chain, artificial intelligence, 5G network and quantum network should be introduced to promote the transformation of county society from digitalization to digitalization." From data-driven development to data intellectualization and artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is worth mentioning that the government, enterprises, citizens and other parties enjoy the benefits and advantages of smart cities, in which the role of standard building can not be underestimated.
            </p>
            <p>
               Huang Zhiwei, Chairman of the Standard Alliance (China) Institutions, pointed out that standards must go first in economic development and social progress. Intelligent city is a new concept and mode of urban development. It is the inherent demand of urban sustainable development. It is also the product of a new generation of information technology innovation applied to the deep integration of urban economic development. We should play the role of standardized basic connectivity, standardize the sharing methods, mechanisms and paths of data resources in smart cities, and promote the coordinated development of all kinds of infrastructure in smart cities. In addition, we should play the role of standardization and unification, improve the quality and effect of data resources, promote standardization innovation and lead role, and explore the path and mode of the mature development of new smart cities.
