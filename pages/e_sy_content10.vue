               <b>Emblem</b> 
            </p><br/>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The emblem of the Digital China Construction Summit takes the Chinese character "Number" as the creative starting point, and integrates the cultural connotation of Chinese characters with the international modern style, presenting the new dream of digital China in the new era. The emblem has gorgeous colors, and different colors represent different areas of digital application.
                The overall shape not only reflects the diversity and sharing of the Digital China Construction Summit, but also has Chinese characteristics. "Number" strokes are dynamic and vigorous, implying the theme of the Digital China Summit "Driving Modernization by Informatization and Accelerating the Construction of Digital China".
                It will become a platform for information development policy release, e-government and digital economic development achievements display, theoretical experience and practice exchange of digital China construction.

                The emblem "number" combines design elements such as "middle", "good", "wave" and "banyan leaf". Among them, the implied word "Zhong" stands for digital China and highlights its attributes; the implied word "good" stands for the bright prospects for the future development of China and the world brought by the development of digital economy; and the implied word "wave".
                It represents the tremendous impact and power brought by the digital wave, and the implied "banyan leaves" represent the city banyan tree in Fuzhou, the host of the Digital China Construction Summit, which symbolizes the indomitable spirit of Fuzhou people.
